# MyOS2

Since you are going to build or to read the source code of this Operating System Kernel, I assume that you are a skilled programmer. That means you should have got common sense of programming and experience of building open source projects. So this document, and those listed follow, will not teach you HOW TO about basic things(how to write and build a C-language program, how to use build tools, how to mount a disk, etc.). I have and will try my best to make the steps in line with convention and common sense.
